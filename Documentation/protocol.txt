ANKO network protocol
=====================

Introduction
------------

The whole protocol has been designed to reduce latency over bandwidth.
It is build over UDP.  The protocol is inspired from the one designed
by John Carmack for Quake 3.

Two nodes are involved: the sender and the receiver.


Terminology
-----------

  - snapshot: Data (to be sended) identified by a sequence number
  - synched snapshot: Snapshot known by both the sender and the receiver
  - diff: A difference between two snapshot


Properties
----------

The protocol is designed to have the following listed properties.
  - Build over UDP
  - Reduce latency over bandwidth
  - When there is nothing to send, nothing is sent
  - Simple logic for both the sender and the receiver
  - A node can be both receiver and sender [1]

[1]: It is true for every protocol, but we make it very easy and
straightforward.


Design
------

The sender send differential between two snapshots, and the receiver
send acknowledgement to let the sender know wich snapshot has been well
received.

	+----------+                        +----------+
	|          |  ------- diff ------>  |          |
	|  Sender  |                        | Receiver |
	|          |  <------ ack  -------  |          |
	+----------+                        +----------+


Packet layout
-------------

Field greater than a byte must be in network byte order.  No gap
between fields.  The protocol do not specify the format of the diff,
it is up the the application to come with his own format.

In the following, `from`, `to` and `ack` field must have the same
size as they are all sequence number.  This size is not fixed for now
[1], it might be just a byte (uint8_t) or two bytes (uint16_t).

[1]: I think even uint8_t might be enough, I need to think more about
it.  It will be nice since the protocol would become byte-order
independant, making things even simpler.

Sender's packet layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        +---+---+---+---+=== ... ===+
        | from  |  to   |   diff    |
        +---+---+---+---+=== ... ===+

Receiver's packet layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        +---+---+
        |  ack  |
        +---+---+

Sender + receiver packet layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When nodes are both sender and receiver, the packet layout has a
unique layout.

        +---+---+---+---+---+---+=== ... ===+
        | from  |  to   |  ack  |   diff    |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+=== ... ===+


Processing packets
------------------

This section describe how the sender and the receiver deals with
incoming packets and update their internal state.

The whole logic rely on the fact that at any time, both the sender and
the receiver have at least one snapshot that they know the other
have.  This snapshot is called the "synched snapshot".

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the begining of the connnection, the sender and the receiver create
a dummy snapshot.  This is a snapshot with every fields set to zero.
This snapshot is considered synchronized since they both know the
content of it : zero.  The sequence number of the dummy snapshot is
zero.

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        | dummy |  <------ synched ------>  | dummy |
        +-------+                           +-------+

Establishing the connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is not particular way to start the connection.  The sender just
start to send diff to the receiver.

Shutdown a connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is not particular way to shutdown a connection.  The sender will
just stop to send diff.  The protocol provide no facilities to notice
the receiver about the end of the connection.  The notification is not
of the ressort of the protocol : the notification must be inside the
snapshot, managed by the application.

Main logic
~~~~~~~~~~

The sender is the one who produce new snapshots, with an increasing
sequence number for each new snapshot.  Here is a picture of what it
look's like:

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  15   |  <------ synched ------>  |  15   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  16   |                           |   ?   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  17   |
        +-------+
        |  18   |
        +-------+
        |  19   |
        +-------+
        |   .   |
	    .
	    .

The diagram also show the synched snapshot.  The sender then send a
diff between the synched snapshot (15 in our example) and the most
recent one (19 in our example).  It does send diff continuously unless
their is no non-synched snapshot.

The receiver just wait for diff to come.  Once a diff comes, the
receiver add it add it to his own list

The receiver then send an acknowledgement for the most
recent non-synched snapshot.  Their is no need on the receiver side to
send continuously acknowledgement.  The receiver can only send on
acknowledgement each time he receive a diff.

The following diagram illustrate the state after the sender sent a
diff between 15 and 19.

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  15   |  <------ synched ------>  |  15   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  16   |                ---------  |  19   |
        +-------+               /           +-------+
        |  17   |              /
        +-------+             /  ack 19
        |  18   |            /
        +-------+           /
        |  19   |  <--------
        +-------+
        |   .   |
	    .
	    .

Once the sender receive the acknowledgement, it considere the
acknowledged snapshot as synched.  This not yet the case of the
receiver.

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  19   |  <------ synched ------>  |  15   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |   .   |                           |  19   |
            .                               +-------+
	    .

Later, the sender will send another diff, from the newly synched
snapshot (19 in our example) to a new snapshot (20 in the following
example)

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  19   |  <------ synched ------>  |  15   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  20   |  >---------------   ---<  |  19   |
        +-------+           diff   \ /      +-------+
	|   .   |                   +---->  |  20   |
	    .                               +-------+
	    .

Since the sender used the snapshot acknowledged by the receiver, the
receiver can now considered it synched.  Finally the loop can start
again, with the receiver sending an acknowledgement...

         Sender                             Receiver
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  19   |  <------ synched ------>  |  19   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
        |  20   |                           |  20   |
        +-------+                           +-------+
	|   .   |
	    .
	    .
